# Buttons
In this section we are going to learn about buttons in tkinter. Specifically about the normal buttons (those clicky-clacity ones), checkboxes (those that you would use for your shopping list app) and radio_buttons (that you will use in exam with 4 option and one of them is true).
- To use them properly we are going to need tkinter variables.
